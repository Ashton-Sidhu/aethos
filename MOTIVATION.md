I created this library to help automate the data science/machine learning pipeline and have all the tools required for analysis in one place. I grew tired having to go back and look at code to find implementation for a certain type of analysis, googling for the implementation and converting PoCs to production level code or a microservice. I wanted to be able to focus more time on thinking about the analysis and the techniques to apply instead of worrying about developing them and finding implementations.

Secondly there were alot of people that wanted to try data science that were in a different technical stream but and were blocked due to knowledge and technical barriers. My goal was to remove the technical barriers, so that as long as they understand the techniques at a high level, they can work with data scientists and help contribute to performing some analysis with just one line of code or a click of a button - allowing the data scientist or ML engineer to focus on interpreting/applying the results.
